# Bento Box - Big Project Team 7
### Processes of Object Oriented Programming - Spring 2024
### University of Central Florida

#### Project Description: 

**Bento Box** is both a web application as well as a mobile application, that allows users to browse, rate, and find anime shows that they like. Once an user signs up, they will be redirected to a preference quiz, the app will then suggest different anime shows for the user to watch based on the user's preferences.

The core features of the app is swiping on different shows to like/dislike them, and add them to the user's library for "watch later". This app is inspired on the popular platforms Rotten Tomatoes and LetterBoxd.

#### In this Repo:
There are two branches: Web app (main) and mobile (mobile-app), the main branch Hosts the application on Heroku, and the mobile-app contains the files for the working mobile app.
